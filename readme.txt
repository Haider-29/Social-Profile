This file explains how to compile and run MySocialProfile. First, please have 

all java files provided in one folderand keep them in one location as that will be 

crucial for having no errors upon compilation. The java files that should be provided 

to you are ArrayHeap.java, MySocialProfile.java, mysocialprofile.txt, __________, and _____________

Once all filesprovided are in one location, open Command Prompt (or Terminal) and 

direct it to the folder where the files are located. Next, enter javac 

MySocialProfile.java which will compile the code. Next, you can start the program by 

inputting java main. After that, the program will begin and you will be introduced 

to the welcome screen and you can go ahead from there. One thing that may not be obvious 

about the user interface is that when you are on the second homepage, the output of the

option you chose will appear at the top of your terminal/cmd as the options will be loaded

in again. WE STRONGLY ADVISE NOT USING A PREMADE USER OR FILE. UPON STARTING UP THE PROGRAM FOR 

THE FIRST TIME, PLEASE CREATE YOUR OWN PROFILE AND GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS AS IT BEST MIMICKS

A NORMAL SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT. WE ARE AIMING FOR 100% AUTHENTICITY AND USER SATISFACTION.
